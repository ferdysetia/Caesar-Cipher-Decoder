# Caesar-Cipher-Decoder
Caesar Cipher Decoder displays possible decoded texts for shifts -25 to 25 in a table format.

## What is Caesar Cipher?

The Caesar cipher is a classic cryptographic method used to encode messages. This technique was first employed by Julius Caesar, a Roman general and leader, to send secret messages to his subordinates. The Caesar cipher works by replacing each letter in the original text (plaintext) with another letter located at a specific position in the alphabet. The shift in letter positions is determined by a fixed value known as the key.

## How the Caesar Cipher Decoder Works ?
The Caesar Cipher Decoder reverses the encoding process by shifting each letter in the encoded text back to its original position in the alphabet. This process uses the same key that was applied during encoding. For example, if the key is 3:

- The letter D becomes A,
- The letter E becomes B,
- And so on.

The shift operates in a circular fashion, so the first letter (A) wraps back to the last letter (Z) if necessary.

## Steps to Use the Caesar Cipher Decoder

1. Open the Application:
- Access the Caesar Cipher Decoder application via your browser.

2. Enter Encoded Text:
- Locate the text area labeled "Enter Encoded Text."
- Paste or type the encoded message into this field.
- Click Decode

3. Press the "Decode" button to start the decryption process. The application will process the encoded text and generate all possible decoded results for shifts between -25 and 25.

4. A table titled "Decoded Results" will appear:
Each row displays
- The shift value.
- The corresponding decoded text.
A "Copy" button to save the decoded text to the clipboard. Copy Decoded Text

5. Identify the correct decoded text by reviewing the results:
- Click the "Copy" button next to the desired text.
- A confirmation alert will notify you that the text has been successfully copied.
